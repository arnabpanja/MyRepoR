# MyRepoR
My Working Repository for R. It was a great learning experience to be able to 
configure this repository and connect it to RStudio.

------- Contribution on 22nd May 2021 -----------------------------------------

Mobile Price Classification using Kaggle Data Set and applying the Support 
Vector Machines and its different non-linear kernels i.e. Radial, Polynomial, 
Sigmoid. You will observe a very good comparative study of the training error 
and test error rates of these kernels. 
Random Forest is also applied as a reference model to understand given a
training and test data set how the performances of a Support Vector Machine 
Model compare with it. 
You will see some plots with ggplot2 as well which does not need mentioning


Keep watching this space for some good stuff on R !!!

Thanks !!!
