# MyRepoR
My Working Repository for R. It was a great learning experience to be able to 
configure this repository and connect it to RStudio.

An illustration of Hierarchical Clustering as a method of unsupervised learning 
is demonstrated with a RMD script hierarchical_clustering.rmd. This is an applied
exercise of the book ISLR and analyzes the US Arrests data set to perform Hierarchical 
Clustering. Dendrogram plots are shown for the hierarchical clusters. 
Some interesting observations can be obtained from this notebook when the clustering
is done on both a scaled version of the data and the un-scaled version of the data. 
The plots are also interesting and depicts the variations of both the approach.

Lots of learning to do but so little a lifespan we have !!!

Dataset Courtesy :- Kaggle

Data Set Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/anmolkumar/health-insurance-cross-sell-prediction


Health Insurance Cross Sell Predictions have been added today. The script 
insurance_cross_sell.R uses the Kaggle Data set of Health Insurance Cross 
Sell and applies the XgBoost Alogorithm to predict whether a customer 
can be be cross sold a health insurance plan based on a set of predictors. 
As the response variable is a bit screwed and based on the feedback from the
Kaggle community the data has been balanced out by under-sampling with the 
help of the ROSE package and its function ovun.sample. 
This exercise can be a good tutorial on how to 

1. Use the R XGboost Package
2. Use the ROSE package for handling imbalanced data sets

Mobile Price Classification using Kaggle Data Set and applying the Support 
Vector Machines and its different non-linear kernels i.e. Radial, Polynomial, 
Sigmoid. You will observe a very good comparative study of the training error 
and test error rates of these kernels. 
Random Forest is also applied as a reference model to understand given a
training and test data set how the performances of a Support Vector Machine 
Model compare with it. 
You will see some plots with ggplot2 as well which does not need mentioning


Keep watching this space for some good stuff on R !!!

Thanks !!!
